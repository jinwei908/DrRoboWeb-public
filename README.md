# Doctor Robo Web Server v1.0.4

This is a Web Server - Doctor Robo Web Server - I developed for the ASEAN 100 Hackathon for Connected Smart Cities from 2nd October to 3rd October 2017. 

This framework utilizes the HTTP protocol to receive data from multiple applications (e.g. Doctor's Application / Patient's Application) and converts it into data in a Relational Database (MySQL) to be read and acted upon.

This project is unique because it utilizes the Amazon IoT Button and SNS services to process information and call the ambulance with a touch of a button.

This has been deployed on the Amazon Cloud so it can be accessed from anywhere, anytime.

*This project is built in 2 days from 2nd OCT 2017 to 3rd OCT 2017 for the ASEAN 100 Hackathon, It comes with 4 other applications (Doctor, Patient, Ambulance, Kiosk) as well as numerous IoT sensors and motors to power the entire system.*
